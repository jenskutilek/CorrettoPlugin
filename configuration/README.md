# Global Default Configuration File For Corretto

The file will be autogenerated at `~/Library/Application Support/Glyphs 3/global.correttoconfig.yaml` when Corretto first runs.

You can customize the order of plugins to your liking.

Remember that the order of plugins is important, e.g. the `corretto.plugins.Save` module
needs to come after all modules that modify the generated font, so that the
modifications will be saved to disk.
