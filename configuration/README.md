# Global Default Configuration File For Corretto

Copy the yaml file to `~/Library/Application Support/Glyphs 3/global.correttoconfig.yaml`.

You can customize the order of plugins to your liking.

Remember that the `corretto.plugins.Save` needs to come after any module that modifies
the generated font, so that modifications will be saved to disk.
