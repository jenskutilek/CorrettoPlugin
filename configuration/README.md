# Global Default Configuration File For Corretto

Copy the yaml file to `~/Library/Application Support/Glyphs 3/global.correttoconfig.yaml`.

You can customize the order of plugins to your liking.

Remember that the `corretto.plugins.Save` module needs to come after all modules that
modify the generated font, so that the modifications will be saved to disk.
